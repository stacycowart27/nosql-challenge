* I absolutely messed up my connection with MongoDB somehow and was never able to connect to the collection again. I don't know what I did wrong. I spent so long trying to fix it and got frustrated and ran out of time. I'll take the zero if this is even accepted as it's late. That's what I get for waiting until the last minute.
